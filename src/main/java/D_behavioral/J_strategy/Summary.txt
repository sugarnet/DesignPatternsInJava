* Motivation
- Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher- and lower-level parts
- Making tea can be decomposed into
    - The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup); and
    - Tea-specific things (put teabag into water)
- The high-level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate
    - Supported by beverage-specific strategies

* Definition
Enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected either at run-time (dynamic) or compile-time (static)
Also known as a policy (esp. in the c++ world)

* Summary
- Define an algorithm at a high level
- Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
- Provide for either dynamic or static composition of strategy in the overall algorithm
