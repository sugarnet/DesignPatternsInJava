* Motivation
- Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts + specifics
- Strategy pattern does this through composition
    - High-level uses an interface
    - Concrete implementations implement the interface
- Template method does the same thing through the inheritance
    - Overall algorithms makes use of abstract member
    - Inheritors override the abstract members
    - Parent template method invoked

* Definition
Allow us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses.
