* Motivation
- Consider an ordinary telephone
- What do you with it depends on the state of the phone/line
    - If it's ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
    - Phone must be hook to talk/make a call
    - If you try calling someone , and it's busy, you put the handset down
-  Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event (observer pattern)

Definition
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one
state to another (something need to trigger a transition)

A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.

* Summary
- Given sufficient complexity, it pays to formally define possible states and events/triggers
- Can define
    - State entry/exit behavior
    - Action when a particular event causes a transition
    _ Guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
    - Default action when no transitions are found for an event
